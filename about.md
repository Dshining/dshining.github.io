**What I do**

I'm a programmer and lifelong learner. Currently I am working in the small island country - Singapore. I'm fasinated with most of the IT stuffs, especially Data Visualization. I study E-business during undergraduate years, and later transfer to Data Management and Analysis as a master student in Singapore Management University. I think the IT and data world is awesome, as I get to know more, I love it more. Now I work as a C# .Net and Angular JS developer, and also spend quite a lot of time playing with Tableau. With this blog, I wanna seriousely talk about data visualization and randomly jot down my thoughts.
